# Overview

built of rules which have been ordanically added over time. It is intended that this rule
book will be kept up to date as rules are organically added through player suggestions.

If you would like to contribute new rules or modifications to existing rules, please
submit an issue or pull request at the GitHub page which can be found [here](https://github.com/jonpecar/ThreesPlus). New rules will be considered on a case-by-case basis depending

complexity.
