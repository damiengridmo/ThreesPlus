If a player makes an error they will be given an additional face down card. This may
raise the minimum number of cards they must have in their hand.
An error can be anything including but not limited to:
1. Incorrect advice;
2. An incorrect card play;
3. Failure to disclaim the correct phrase as indicated by the per-card rules;
4. A statement which turns out to be false (i.e. ”I will have no cards left after my
turn.”).

It is recommended to make liberal use of the word ”allegedly”.
The responsibility to read the rules is on the individual players and errors shall be
punished indiscriminately
