# Threes Plus the Card Game
This is the rules page for the Threes Plus card game. This is a modification of the card game Threes
which can be played with one or more standard decks of playing cards. This variant is
built of rules which have been ordanically added over time. It is intended that this rule
book will be kept up to date as rules are organically added through player suggestions.

If you would like to contribute new rules or modifications to existing rules, please
submit an issue or pull request at the GitHub page which can be found [here](https://github.com/jonpecar/ThreesPlus). New rules will be considered on a case-by-case basis depending
on how the integrate with existing rules, the value they add and their level of
complexity.
