How To Play: Playing
====================


Order of Play
-------------
.. index:: Order of Play

Play will go in order around the table in an order as determined at the start of the game or
as determined by the cards. The cards which change the direction of play are described
in the cards section.
On each player’s turn they may do one of two options (at the discretion of the player):

1.  Pick up the cards in play if they cannot go or if they choose to do so;
2.  Play a card or cards if they have a valid move.

What Can Be Played
------------------
.. index:: What To Play

Cards shall be played in ascending numeric order, with Four being the lowest value
card and Ace being highest (Two and Three are special cards and do not have an value
as such). There are many exceptions to this rule which are detailed in the rules for
individual cards.

A player must play cards whose face values are equal to or higher than the top card on
the play stack.

If a player has multiple cards of the same value, any number of these may be played in
one turn.

If a player plays a card of the same value as their face up cards, they may choose to
include their face up cards of this value in their play. If this action clears all face up cards
in one turn (i.e. no face up cards were previously played) then the player may play one
face down card.

End of Turn
-----------
.. index:: End of Turn

At the end of the players turn they must have in their hand the greater of:

1.  3 cards;
2.  Number of face down cards in front of the player.

If after completing their turn they have fewer than this, they must pickup until reaching
that number or until there are no more draw cards available.

During Others’ Turns
--------------------
.. index:: During Other Turns

If at any point during another players’ turn any player loses cards such that they are
below their minimum threshold, they must pickup from the draw pile to their minimum
quantity if possible.
