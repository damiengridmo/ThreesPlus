Card Rules: Two
=================

.. index:: Two Card


1.  Twos may be played on any card except for a Seven余

2.  When a Two is the top card of the play stack it has effectively no value and is
    equivalent to an empty stack余

3.  When one or more Twos are played sequentially by the same player, players shall
    pass cards to the left. The quantity passed shall match the number of Twos played余

4.  When more than one Two is played sequentially, all but one two shall be moved to
    the discard pile. This applies when any twos are in sequence on the stack, even
    if played by different players余

5.  When only two players remain any Two which is played shall be discarded.
