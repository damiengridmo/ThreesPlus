rule.

If four or more of the same card are at any point played in a row, either by the same
player or subsequent players, all cards currently in the playing pile will be discarded.
The current player shall then receive an additional turn.

.. index:: Six of a Kind

If exactly six of the same card are at any point played in a row, either by the same
player or subsequent players, all player cards and the currently in-play cards shall be

who caused the event shall be responsible for shuffling and dealing these cards. The
current player shall then receive an additional turn.
