Card Rules: Ten
=================

.. index:: Ten Card

1.  Tens may be played on any card with the exception of Sevens;

2.  When a Ten is played, the in-play stack is immediately discarded, the player
    receives another turn and play resumes in the opposite direction;

3.  If more than one Ten is played by the same player within the same string of turns
    (i.e. no other players have taken a turn in between), the player shall nominate the
    direction of play;
    
4.  If Tens are used to clear all face up cards, the player shall, after discarding the
    in-play stack, flip all face-down cards. This action will ignore requirements for
    ascending order or as otherwise described by the rules. Actions normally resulting
    of the flipped cards shall not occur
