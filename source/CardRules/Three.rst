Card Rules: Three
=================

.. index:: Three Card


1.  Threes may be played on any card except for a SevenÍ¾

2.  Threes adopt the value of the last card played which was not a Three;

3.  Threes only count towards card runs for threes, not for the value they adopt (e.g.
    2 Fives followed by 2 Threes would not count as 4 Fives).
