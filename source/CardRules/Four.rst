Card Rules: Four
=================

.. index:: Four Card

1.  Players must always keep a four. This will be enforced by the Three Sevens rule. See :ref:`Seven<Card Rules: Seven>`;

2.  Fours may be played on a Jack;

3.  Fours cannot cause a Four of a Kind or Six of a Kind event as described in :ref:`General Rules<Card Rules: General Card Rules>`.
    Fours cannot be discarded on their own.

4.  If 12 Fours are played in a row, the player who places the final Four immediately "gets out"
    (see :ref:`Ending The Game<How To Play: Ending The Game>`) and
    their face up and face down cards should be discarded into the play pile irrespective of their
    value.
