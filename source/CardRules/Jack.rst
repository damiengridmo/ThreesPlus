Card Rules: Jack
=================

.. index:: Jack Card

1.  Jacks may not be played on a Four;

2.  If exactly three Jacks are played sequentially, the player must disclaim ”Three
    Jacks”. The three Jacks are then discarded off the top of the pile. The next turn
    must then play a Four. If a Four cannot be played then the play stack must be
    picked up. In the event of a pickup, at least one card must be picked up. Inability
    to do so shall be considered an :ref:`Error<How To Play: Errors>`.
