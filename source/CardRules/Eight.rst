Card Rules: Eight
=================

.. index:: Eight Card

1.  When an Eight is played, the player will receive an additional turn. All usual rules
    apply for this turn (e.g. if they cannot play equal to or higher than an Eight, they
    will pickup all in-play cards);

2.  Where multiple Eights are played, the player shall receive a quantity of additional
    turns equivalent to the number of Eights played;
    
3.  Where the quantity of Eights played triggers any other event (e.g. ”Four of a Kind” and
    "Six of a Kind" as detailed in :ref:`General Rules<Card Rules: General Card Rules>`),
    the player shall also receive the additional turns imparted by the other event (e.g.
    in the case of 4 Eights being played, the player would receive 5 turns).
