Welcome to the Threes Plus Rules!
=======================================
This is the rules page for the Threes Plus card game. This is a modification of the card game Threes
which can be played with one or more standard decks of playing cards. This variant is
built of rules which have been ordanically added over time. It is intended that this rule
book will be kept up to date as rules are organically added through player suggestions.

If you would like to contribute new rules or modifications to existing rules, please
submit an issue or pull request at the GitHub page which can be found 
here_.
New rules will be considered on a case-by-case basis depending
on how the integrate with existing rules, the value they add and their level of
complexity. Please provide details in your pull request or issue description outlining
how the proposed change will improve the game.

In addition to rule changes, please feel free to contribute improvements to the rules
pages including items such as illustrations or improved descriptions.
