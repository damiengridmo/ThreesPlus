How To Play: Ending The Game
============================

.. index:: Ending the Game

Players ”get out” by playing all their cards from their hand, face up and face down.
Players may not :get out” while they still have unused additional turns which they have
accrued (e.g. from Eights or Tens, section **2.2.8 and 2.2.10**). If a player has no further
cards to play but still has accrued turns, they shall play a card randomly from the discard pile.

The game ends when there is a single loser remaining.
