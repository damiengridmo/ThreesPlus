How To Play: Dealing
=====================

.. index:: Dealing

Each player will be dealt the following:

1. 3 face down cards in front of the player;
2. 3 face up cards on top of the face down cards;
3. 3 hand cards.

The number of cards dealt to each player may be agreed by the players to be a quantity
other than three.

The face down cards must never be viewed by any player currently participating until
they are to be played. If a player is to look at a face down card before it is played they
will take the face down card into their hand, the face down card will be replaced with
a new face down card and an additional face down card will be given to the offending
player as described under [[How To Play.Errors]].
